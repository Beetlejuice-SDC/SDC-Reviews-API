# SDC-Reviews

## Reviews-API

The goal of the SDC project is to support the existing retail web application with a modernized system able to withstand web-scale traffic loads. We are a team of three engineers who inherited a legacy codebase, our strategy is to decompose existing API into constituent services. Each member took ownership of one API service. I was responsible for rebuilding the reviews API and constructing a database and server layer to support production-level traffic.
